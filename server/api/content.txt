This recipe focuses on building layers of deliciousness with sautéed vegetables, a herby ricotta mixture, and plenty of cheese.

**Yields:** 4 generous servings
**Prep time:** 30-40 minutes
**Cook time:** 40-50 minutes

### Ingredients

**For the Vegetables:**
*   2 tbsp olive oil
*   1 medium onion, diced
*   3 cloves garlic, minced
*   8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced
*   1 medium zucchini, diced or thinly sliced
*   1 bell pepper (any color), diced
*   5 oz fresh spinach (or 10 oz frozen, thawed and squeezed dry)
*   1 tsp dried Italian seasoning
*   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

**For the Sauce:**
*   24-28 oz jar good quality marinara sauce (or homemade)
*   1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped (optional)
*   Pinch of sugar (optional, to balance acidity)

**For the Cheese Mixture:**
*   15 oz (about 1.75 cups) part-skim ricotta cheese
*   1 large egg, lightly beaten
*   1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (plus more for topping)
*   1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
*   1/2 tsp salt
*   1/4 tsp black pepper
*   Pinch of nutmeg (optional, enhances cheesy flavor)

**Other:**
*   6-8 lasagna noodles (oven-ready/no-boil or regular, cooked al dente according to package directions)
*   2 cups shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese

### Equipment
*   9x9 inch baking dish or a small rectangular baking dish (approx. 2-quart capacity)
*   Large skillet
*   Large mixing bowl

### Instructions

**1. Prepare the Vegetables:**
    *   Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
    *   Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
    *   Add sliced mushrooms, zucchini, and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and most of their liquid has evaporated, about 8-10 minutes. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
    *   If using fresh spinach, add it to the skillet and cook until wilted, then remove from heat. If using thawed frozen spinach, squeeze out as much water as possible, then stir it into the cooked vegetables off the heat. Set aside.

**2. Prepare the Sauce:**
    *   In a small saucepan, gently warm the marinara sauce over low heat. Stir in the fresh basil (if using) and a pinch of sugar (if desired).

**3. Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:**
    *   In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and nutmeg (if using). Mix well until thoroughly combined.

**4. Cook Noodles (if not using oven-ready):**
    *   If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to package directions until al dente. Drain well and lay them out on parchment paper or a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.

**5. Assemble the Lasagna:**
    *   **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
    *   **First Layer:** Spread about 1/2 cup of marinara sauce evenly on the bottom of your baking dish.
    *   **Noodles:** Arrange 2-3 lasagna noodles over the sauce (you may need to break them to fit, depending on your dish size).
    *   **Ricotta Layer:** Spread half of the ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles.
    *   **Vegetable Layer:** Spoon half of the cooked vegetable mixture over the ricotta.
    *   **Mozzarella:** Sprinkle about 3/4 cup of mozzarella cheese over the vegetables.
    *   **Sauce:** Drizzle another 1/2 cup of marinara sauce over the mozzarella.
    *   **Repeat:** Place another layer of 2-3 noodles. Spread the remaining ricotta mixture, then the remaining vegetables, and another 3/4 cup of mozzarella. Drizzle with 1/2 cup of marinara sauce.
    *   **Top Layer:** Place the final 2-3 noodles on top. Cover generously with the remaining marinara sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and extra grated Parmesan cheese.

**6. Bake the Lasagna:**
    *   Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil (you can lightly spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray to prevent cheese from sticking).
    *   Bake for 30 minutes.
    *   Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly golden brown.

**7. Rest and Serve:**
    *   Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for **at least 10-15 minutes** before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and prevents it from falling apart.
    *   Serve hot with a side salad and some crusty bread!

### Tips & Variations:

*   **Extra Veggies:** Feel free to add other quick-cooking vegetables like chopped kale, roasted eggplant, or finely diced carrots to your vegetable mixture.
*   **Spice It Up:** Add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the marinara sauce or vegetable mixture for a kick.
*   **Herb Power:** Don't skip the fresh herbs! They make a huge difference in flavor.
*   **Make Ahead:** You can assemble the entire lasagna a day in advance, cover it tightly, and refrigerate. Add an extra 10-15 minutes to the covered baking time if baking from cold.
*   **Cheese Options:** Experiment with other cheeses like provolone or fontina for different flavor profiles.
*   **Prevent Watery Lasagna:** The key is to thoroughly cook the vegetables and squeeze the spinach dry. This prevents excess moisture from making your lasagna soggy.
